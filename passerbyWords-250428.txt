- exact reference
    - pangea and panthalasa - this two words comes from different source. pangea is someting i know after reading several sources relating to dinosaur, and panthalasa is a word i found while i look up details of pangea. because of these two words, it does makes me wonder about what’s the words to represent current situation, since pangea and panthalasa are words that use to represent old continent and old sea, therefore, the word hyper-fragmented represent the new continent and seven sea represent new sea in general terms
